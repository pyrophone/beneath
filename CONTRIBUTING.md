Guidelines for git
==================
To use the repo, please clone the dev branch of the project or create your own branch, if youâ€™d really like. If creating a branch, name it the feature being worked on (e.g dev-quests). When you are done modifying the project, commit your work to the dev branch and submit a pull request for the master branch. After being approved by Preston or me (Gio), it will be merged with the master branch by me. Individual tasks will also be assigned by me.

Guidelines for code
===================
Please see the [Coding Guidelines](Assets/Scripts/CodingGuidelines.md) for information.
