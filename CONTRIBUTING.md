Guidelines for git
==================
To use the repo, please clone the dev branch of the project (or create your own branch, if youâ€™d really like). When you are done modifying the project, commit your work to the dev branch and submit a pull request for the master branch. After being approved, it will be merged with the master branch

Guidelines for code
===================
Please see the [Coding Guidelines](Assets/Scripts/CodingGuidelines.md) for information.
