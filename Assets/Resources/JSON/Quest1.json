		"Aleksander: You wouldn’t want to walk into a stranger!",
		"Aleksander: We’re going to walk down the Stradun to the Church of St. Blaise. The Archbishop will be waiting there for us.",
		"Aleksander tells you tales of Dubrovnik as you walk, calling out to various traders and individuals on the street. He is clearly a friend of the people.",
		"Alexander begins to verse you in the city’s rich history, starting with the fountains and the drought that spurred their construction.",
		"Alexander tells you of the monastery and the Stradun, recounting tales as you walk toward the Church that is your goal.",
		"Alexander: Come now, we're close to the Church, follow me!",
		"You arrive at the Church of Saint Blaise. Here you will meet with the head priest of Dubrovnik and receive his blessing.",
		"The priest thanks you for coming so far to save the good people of Dubrovnik.",
		"He prays over you for a moment, and then gives you a license to carry with you that shows that you are a friend of the church and of the krsnik.",
